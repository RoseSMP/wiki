# Lands Commands

> /lands, /land, or /l all do the same thing.

`/lands` by itself opens the lands menu. From there you can change permissions, manage users, and rename your claim.

## Edit

The edit command makes the next commands you execute apply to a specific claim.

Usage:
```
/l edit
```
Switches you to editing the claim you're standing in.
```
/l edit name
```
Switches to editing a claim named `name`. 


## Trust

The trust command invites other players to your land, so that they can interact with the claimed blocks.

Usage:
```
/trust player 
/lands trust player
```
Use either of the above commands, replacing `player` with the username of the player you want to invite.

They will have to accept this invite before being able to access your land.

## Claim

The claim command adds the chunk you're currently in to your claim, if it's adjacent to it and is not already claimed.

Usage:
```
/claim
/lands claim
```
