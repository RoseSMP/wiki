# Hooni

Volunteerd at Raccoon City Police dpt. that same day a zombie apocalypse broke out (thank you umbrella you as s-holes) survived, but became half-zombie and was soon taken in by real_lthegamer.

He is chill, childish, smart, and scared of both bugs and silence.

He has one hell of a pair of jaws aka can bite like a mofo
looks weak and small can still beat your ass easily

He's also good at building.
