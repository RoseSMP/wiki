# The Egg League

I was born as a human. My Parents abandoned me, but the Jendal found me years later. He took me to his lab, where i was raised and tormented by his evil control for seeveral years later. On one mission, he sent me to the deep dark to collect samples of sculk items in order 
for Jendal to study the relationship between sculk and souls. But i never returned, not because i took the chance to run away, but I died. A skeleton shot me and i fell into the deep dark and died. Two weeks later, i am resurrected bu the sculk for some unkown reason, confused.
Then the Warden comes out of nowhere and tells me what happend. When I find out Jendal sent me to my death, I was filled with unbearable rage and vengeance. As the news reaches Jendal that I rose from the dead more powerful and intelligent than ever, out of fear he shuts down the lab.
I was then left to surive on my own untill I stumbled into Kazmorez, where I meet Kaz. Since both of us have a mutual foe, we formed a alliance.
I have a faint memory during the two weeks my corpse sat in the deep dark. I have a blurry vision of a massive dark castle that loomed ahead of me.. And when I arrived at the castle inside the throne room, I saw the head warden... With a council by their side.
The head Warden, from what I can remeber was bigger and a lot more buff then any of the other wardens.
He had a gleaming bone crown covered in diamonds, gold, and somehow Netherite?
