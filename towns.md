Johnathan Johnston Phillip Towns Minecraft Jr. Esq. III, also known in-game as T0wns and IRL as Tim, is a 13 year old US-based Minecrafter. He is a member of Dragonvale and an attorney-at-law.

## Discord Introduction

I'm Towns, a 13 year old US-based ball of cringe. I joined the server 3 days before Krafter (therefor i am superior), and I'm glad to be part of the server.
I have ADHD, autism, generalized anxiety disorder, and social pragmatic communication disorder. I don't understand social cues as well as others and tend to inadvertently cause conflict. I would never mean to offend anyone.
My feats are as follows:
* Became the Pope in S2
* Revived a pig as a horcrux through ritual sacrifice
* Coerced my father to kill said pig to revive me after being killed by RoseSMP (the player)
* Got killed again and became famous for being dead
* Created the (unofficial) RoseSMP Merch Store ([Merch](https://rosesmp-merch.creator-spring.com/))
* Got barred from ever being staff so now I am plotting the demise of the user who barred me /hj
* Became the sort of player you either love strongly or hate immensely
I'm a great troubleshooter, probably the best non-lawyer lawyer in the server, and like making music and also publishing said music. I'm also extremely humble.
Don't disturb me, I'm plotting your demise.
