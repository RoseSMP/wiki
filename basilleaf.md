# Basilleaf

Basil Driplaf is from a far off land and had travel to the Rose smp and had met someone. That someone is Tornado.
Tornado gave them shelter until they left the land named, [Sculk city](sculk-city)...
Parents both dead. Siblings: 1 sister which had been missing since basil was 11

### Soul

Basil had bid their soul off to a god. Ever since they have left the land they once called home, an entity has been contacting them and speaking to them through endspeak. Trying to bring them back to the land they live on.
