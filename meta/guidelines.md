# Guidelines

How to structure pages, and all the rules you should follow


## Files

### File formatting

Files are in [markdown](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/markdown-docs), a formatting language. It is fairly simple to learn, [read this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github) to get started. Files *should* follow the [*Markdown Styleguide*](https://github.com/style-guides/Markdown), but we're not too strict about that.


### File names

All markdown files should be named according to the page's title (omitting "The", or any other [articles](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/articles/)), lowercased, and pages with multiple words in the title should be hyphenated. For example, a page titled "*The Shopping District*" would be in a file called "shopping-district.md"


### File Placement

ALL wiki pages should be placed at the "root" of the repository. The only exception is the next rule:


### Meta

Pages talking about the wiki itself should be in [`/wiki/meta/`](/wiki/meta/).
