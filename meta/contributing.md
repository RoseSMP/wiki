## Before You Start

Make sure to read through the [Guidelines](guidelines), and read the [Markdown Page](markdown) for how to format your pages in markdown.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. Make sure you're signed into your Github account. If you don't have one, [create one](https://github.com/join)

2. Go to the [repository page](https://github.com/RoseSMP/wiki) for the RoseSMP wiki on GitHub.

3. Create a "Fork" for you to edit and make changes to.

    1. Click "Fork" on the repository page

        [![Forking RoseSMP/wiki on github](/src/github-rosesmp-wiki-fork.png)](https://github.com/RoseSMP/wiki/fork)

    1. Create the fork!

    1. It's forked!

    Now you have a place to put all your edits to the wiki.    

4. Make your changes! Edit the files in your fork in whatever way you like; [Github.dev](https://github.dev/github/dev), the built-in code editor on github.com, or locally in your own code editor (the [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app helps a lot with this).

    * Don't know markdown? Dont worry! It's quite simple, click [here](markdown) for a quick how-to.

    1. Go to the file you'd like to edit (within the fork you made earlier)

        ![Viewing wiki/matt-rose.md](/src/github-rosesmp-wiki-matt-rose.png)

    1. Click on the Pencil to edit it

    1. Make your changes in the "Edit file" tab, and preview if your markdown code is correct in the "Preview" tab

    1. Save your changes (commit them) to your fork. Make sure to say what your changes are, and that you "Commit directly to the `main` branch"

        ![Committing changes to a file](/src/github-commit-file.png)

    1. Once you've made the changes you want, continue to the next step.


5. Make a Pull Request! Go to the [Pull Request](https://github.com/RoseSMP/wiki/pulls) page of the repository, and click on the big green button that says "New pull request" and click "compare across forks" at the top. Select your fork on the right, and follow the prompts.

    1. Go to the [Pull Requests page](https://github.com/RoseSMP/wiki/pulls) on github, and click "New Pull Request"

        ![Github pull requests page](/src/github-pull-requests.png)

    1. Click on "Compare across forks"

        ![Comparing across forks](/src/github-pr-across-forks.png)

    1. Choose your fork as the "head repository" (hint: it will have your username at the start of it)

        ![picking your fork from the list](/src/github-pr-choose-fork.png)

    1. Create the pull request!

        ![click on "create pull request"](/src/github-pr-create.png)

    1. Tell us a bit about what changes you made, and why you made them. Then, click "Create Pull request" again.

6. Wait for it to be approved. Once it's approved, your changes will be built and deployed to the site! You can see the site being built and deployed on the [actions](https://github.com/RoseSMP/wiki/actions) page of the repository
