1. Make your changes! Edit the files in your fork in whatever way you likeâŽ¯ [Github.dev](https://github.dev/github/dev), the built-in code editor on github.com, or locally in your own code editor (the [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app helps a lot with this).

1. Make a Pull Request! Go to the [Pull Request](https://github.com/RoseSMP/wiki/pulls) page of the repository, and click on the big green button that says "New pull request" and click "compare across forks" at the top. Select your fork on the right, and follow the prompts.

1. Wait for it to be approved. Once it's approved, your changes will be built and deployed to the site!
